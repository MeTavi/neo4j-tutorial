    "\n",
    "This tutorial is written for people with a general technical background, specifically a basic knowledge of databases, working in the terminal, and a good understanding of at least one computer language. It was written with Unix operating systems in mind, so while we discuss installation steps for Windows in brief and have made an effort to support it on a basic level, some of the code (i.e. most if not all the terminal commands) and file locations may differ. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what can this tutorial do for you?\n",
    "* Help you get a Neo4j database up and running quickly on your local machine\n",
    "* Give you a quick guided tour of Neo4j & Cypher to see how they work together\n",
    "* Expose you to two different flavors of Neo4j to Python middleware\n",

    "\n",
    "That said, if you are already well-versed in Neo4j and feel comfortable with Cypher feel free to [grab the DREAM data](#Data-Access) and skip ahead to the second part of the tutorial. Also, don't forget to [install NetworkX](#Installing-Python-to-Neo4j-Middleware-&-NetworkX) for the analysis portion. We're excited to see what analyses people may run now and in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, if you run into any issues, give a shout to either Ben, Eric, or Ian and we'll come lend a hand. Finally, we hope you find this a fun and approachable way to getting started with Neo4j. Happy keyboard mashing!\n",

    "### Install Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "We've tested two ways to setup Neo4j on Mac OS X and one on Microsoft Windows that you can choose from below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Homebrew – Mac OS X\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways you can install Neo4j. If you have homebrew, type the following command into your terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "brew install neo4j\n",
    "```\n",
    "Be sure to take note of what version is installed (there's a chance you may need this in a moment); for me it was 3.0.3, but at the time of writing the latest is 3.0.6. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Desktop Application – Mac OS X & Microsoft Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to the [Neo4j website](https://neo4j.com)\n",
    "* Click the big red Download button\n",
    "* Click the green Download Community Edition button\n",
    "* Select the appropriate download and run through the installation steps required by your OS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Database Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "It's recommended you setup a username/password for Neo4j (that said, read the caveat below before you do.) To do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to your terminal application and open up a new window or pane, and type: \n",
    "```\n",
    "neo4j console\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Next, in your browser navigate to [`http://localhost:7474`](http:////localhost:7474)\n",
    "* You should be prompted to set a new username/password. Of course, make sure it's something you'll remember; resetting your user/pass in Neo4j tends to be a bit of terminal hackery and is poorly documented. If you're having trouble, you can skip down to the [Authentication's No Fun :(](#Authentication's-No-Fun-:-() section to disable authentication; if you already setup a user/pass and forgot it, check out [Some Helpful Installation Hints](#Some-Helpful-Installation-Hints).\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color: green;\">Tip:</span>** *Once you've set this up, you may want to take a moment and explore the Neo4j web application. It's a cute way to play around with some toy databases, check out some nifty network visualizations, send some queries, and get a feel for the syntax and functionality of the Cypher query language. If you came here for the DREAM data and are thinking, 'Meh, I'm not into toys and cute stuff, I'm a hardcore bioinformaticist.', scroll down to the [DREAM Data Access](#DREAM-Data-Access) portion for some much-less-cute (but really it's not bad at all) bioinformatics data.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color: red;\">Caveat:</span>** *The user/pass you set will need to be hardcoded into the Python code of this tutorial early on, so if you feel more comfortable going with the default user/pass, follow the instructions above up to setting your user/pass.*\n",

    "### Installing Python to Neo4j Middleware & NetworkX\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not natively support interacting with Neo4j and requires middleware to do so. There are several available each with their own flavor, one of which is officially sponsored by Neo4j. We'll be using two Python to Neo4j middlewares in this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is the [official Neo4j middleware](https://neo4j.com/developer/python/), which has been designed to expose the Cypher query language in the Python environment and facilitate connecting to any Neo4j instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second middleware is the [unofficial Py2Neo](http://py2neo.org/v3/). The design of this middleware is different; rather than use the Cypher query language (i.e. bumble through learning a language with a syntax that may be quite foreign), Py2Neo provides us with a Pythonic API to access and query the database with almost no knowledge of the Cypher language required. Similar to the official Neo4j, it too allows for easy connecting to any Neo4j instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install the two middlewares, paste the commands below into your terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install neo4j-driver\n",
    "pip3 install py2neo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you plan on exploring the [DREAM Disease Module Identification Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6156761) data, a great package to work with it is [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io). Also, we'll be using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) too. If you don't have them already, paste the commands below into you terminal to install them:\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, sometimes you want to skip learning a new language like Cypher. The Py2Neo middleware, for the most part, allows for this convenience, however, as with the official driver there are benefits & drawbacks (below). Next, we'll run through a similar set of queries to demonstrate some very basic Py2Neo functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color: green;\">Some benefits:</span>**\n",
    "* You get the full flexibility of the Cypher query language (yes, with Py2Neo, you can still use it if required!)\n",
    "* The syntax is largely Pythonic, minimizing language context switching while programming\n",
    "* The driver provides access to database settings and configurations that other middlewares may not expose\n",
    "* Less hardcoding & more sensible use of variables often means less coding\n",

    "**<span style=\"color: red;\">Some drawbacks:</span>**\n",
    "* Requires learning new API methods – you'll still likely have to read documentation \n",
    "* Overly abstracted APIs can obscure underlying logic (Py2Neo avoids this)\n",
    "* Abstracted database querying logic can lead to inefficient code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Programatic API Example\n",
    "Before diving into Py2Neo, it's worth examining what is meant by 'API-Based Programmatic Access'. In short, the idea here is to use Python instead of Cypher when working with Neo4j. To do this, the API provides what is often termed an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) layer. In Py2Neo, this layer is called the Object Graph Mapping (OGM) layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of a sensible ORM requires a careful balancing of abstraction, functionality, and intuitiveness. Because most software interfacing with a database performs only the most basic Create-Read-Update-Destroy (CRUD) operations, many middlewares have a tendency to emphasize intuitiveness and abstraction for these basic functionalities. From there, more complex operations may be left to a generic 'run this \\*complex\\* query using the native DB query language function'. For the Neo4j driver used above, this function is `session.run()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of what an ORM for a Neo4j API might look like is below. Note the function calls...they're Cypher free! Of course, it goes without saying that the example below is merely intended to be illustrative and would need some serious work to be made practical."

    "Security through authentication is important, but we're realists and know that this is a tutorial...so if you installed with homebrew and are having trouble getting the authentication up and running quickly, you can shut off authentication. To do that, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use your terminal to navigate to the following directory (replace `VERSION` with the version number you just wrote down):\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ~/../../usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/VERSION/libexec/conf/\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Now in the ```conf/``` directory, open the file ```neo4j.conf``` using your preferred terminal editor (e.g. Vim, Emacs, Nano)\n",
    "* Scroll through the file until you find the following line (it should be near the top):\n",
    "```\n",
    "# dbms.security.auth_enabled=false\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Per the instructions above it, uncomment the line. It should look like this: \n",
    "```\n",
    "dbms.security.auth_enabled=false\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Save and close the file `neo4j.conf`\n",
    "* Pat your self on the back; your database is now authentication free...\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color: green;\">Tip:</span>** *If you didn't install with Homebrew or are using a different OS (not Mac OS X), these steps should be the same but the location of the `neo4j.conf` file will be different.* \n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color: red;\">Caveat:</span>** *With great power comes great responsibility. In the interest of getting started quickly, we're offering the above instructions as an option. That said, we feel obliged to say that disabling authentication should never, ever be done in a production environment or for any database(s) hosting sensitive data. If you plan on using Neo4j outside the scope of this tutorial, be sure to setup authentication as intended (above). That said, rest assured the Neo4j documentation states that, unless configured to do so, Neo4j will not respond to external requests (i.e. not from your localhost)...although, the same documentation also states the above may make you vulnerable to a number of known attacks (e.g. cross-site scripting).*\n",

    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color: green;\">Tip:</span>** This method was tested on a Homebrew installation, but if you can find the root of your Neo4j installation, from there you should be able to access ```data/dbms/``` and perform ```rm auth``` or similar.*\n",
